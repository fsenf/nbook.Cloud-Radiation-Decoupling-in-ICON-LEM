# Illustrative Examples on Cloud-Radiation Decoupling in ICON-LEM

We show - based on a few cases - how infrequent use of radiation calls lead to a decoupling between radiation-flux and cloud-field variables.

## Analysis
We present 
- [Analysis of Relative Runtime Consumption of Radiation](nbooks/01-Plot-Rad-Runtime.ipynb)
- [Decorrelation Behavior between Cloud and Radiation Fields](nbooks/02-Plot-Cloudvars-vs-Radiation.ipynb)
 

## Model Setup
- ICON LEM v2.6.5
- experiment script are provided under [log](log)
